## Kilovolt Blog Dynamic Updating

**Authors**: Tyler Fishbone,  Brent Williams
**Version**: 1.9.0

## Overview
Welcome to our Kilovolt Blog. On it you will find a dynamically rendered list of blog entries all containing different themed lorem ispum texts.
There is also a new.html page which allows blog manager to write articles them self and export a formatted JSON for dynamically.

## Getting Started
All files needed for opening and running this site are included in this Github Repo. Simply fork or download repo and open in the index.html file after files are fully downloaded.

## Architecture
This site makes use of HTML and CSS, as well as the @ media feature which gives the page responsive functionality upon screen resizing.
Though a navigation bar is included the links are not yet live.
This blog has a blogArticle.js file that contains all the raw articles to be rendered, and an article.js that renders the articles there.
If no articles exist when the server starts to rund, it fills a SQL database (assuming it exists) with a stock set of articles.
Requires pgsql, express, body parser npm packages.
