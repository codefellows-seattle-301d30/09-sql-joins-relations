SQL Joins Relations

**Author**: Jose Reyes, D\Steve Starwalt
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
As a developer, I want to utilize SQL queries so that I can join data together in the database and access it based on specific criteria.


## Getting Started
Gte the starter code from the codefellow reop by forking and cloning.  Add the proper conSring for your environment. Run a npm i to install the node modules, write the get, post, and put querys.  Run the CRUD troublershooting guide to ensure it all works.

## Architecture
This app will allowthe user to write and article.  The data etered by the author is run thru a constructor function and stored in an array.  The article.js file will call functions on the server.js file to dreate, store, update and delete files from the model.
